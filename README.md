# Tile Game/Guess The Pokemon

This is a small project using my current knowledge for REACT

**Link:** https://tile-guess-pokemon.netlify.app/


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** REACT ONLY, and CSS

I wanted to flex my React muscles on this project. I have been solo learning the library in order to complete my MERN stack skills.
The game itself is failry simple, the point is to figure out the image in as few guesses as possible. Thaking cues from Wordle and others in that genre you get 5 guesses before the image is revealed. The tiles are interactable onClick and dissapear when clicked on. You remove 3 tiles per guess. The main gameplay loop was in large part thanks to state from React. When a tile dissapears and having 3 tiles able to be clicked before locking the user out all took a large part of the logic with state. The rest was introducing state and managing it through different React logic. 

## Lessons Learned:
I learned a lot about implementing React tools into an actual project. Learning React and actually putting React into a project are two different things. IT's important to keep everything organized and labeled correctly as well. Great experiance.
